realexchangerate
================

A simple hybrid application built with **[Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/ "ionic framework")** to get *Real Time Exchange Rate* with 
*historical* exchange rate support.

Only the necessery files are included [index.html, app.js, money.js], please replace them after creating the blank application using **[Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/ "ionic framework")**. money.js is maintained by **Open Exchange Rates**  [http://josscrowcroft.github.io/money.js/](http://josscrowcroft.github.io/money.js/ "money.js")

If you are interested to check how to setup the environment for **[Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/ "ionic framework")** or how to created the blank application you can check my blog post **[http://blog.shiefuzzaman.com](http://blog.shiefuzzaman.com/ "blog.shiefuzzaman.com")**. 

For real time exchange rate I have used the api from **[https://openexchangerates.org/](https://openexchangerates.org/ "openexchangerates")**. Besides their paid plan they are also offering a [forever free plan](https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free "free plan") with 1000 Request/Month.
